Python for programmers class
Group Assignment
Description:
- The group project involved refactoring and extending a project, in this case a projectile game, and emphasizing modular and object-oriented programming
- The goal of this assignment was to modify the code so that it can be easily maintained, modified, and adapted to new requirements and design references. This was done through forking and collaborative work on the codebase.

- Major changes include: turning the cannon into a tank (can move in all four directions), allowing them to shoot at each other, creation of targets with different shapes and movement patterns and’s bombs that can be dropped on the targets by the cannon
